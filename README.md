#  jQuery Search Filters

## Summary:

Sometimes you don't want to use ajax (for SEO purposes) and yet you wish to improve the user experience. This sample code here is taken as an inspiration from Yelp's search filters.

If you have never used yelp, basically the search filters allow users to filter their search results by a specific category and tags. However, the results should appear on a different page, accessible by search engine bots and they should work with various different tags/options selected at the same time.

So take a look at this code, and let me know if you can think of any features to add. I am going to update a cleaner version of this and then add a neat front-end to it.

Here is a sample demo of how this works: gauravmali.com/sandbox/yelp/

Notice the URL as you click on the elements. More to come.
